# DSA456-DataCom

## Lab 0 
- Learning how to create a repository
- Learned how to use codespace
- Write the Hello World program in python in the helloworld.py file
- Add, commit and push the code into your repo
- Write the factorial function in lab0.cpp
- The factorial function is passed an unsigned integer n. It returns n! = n* (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3)....1. By definition, 0! = 1
- Learned to write a formula for calculating the length of the hypothenus (c) given right angle triangle with side lengths a and a in LaTex.
$$c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)$$
- Reflection questions/answers in lab0.md

## Lab 1
- Objective is to learn the basic os Python programming
- Understand some key differences between C/C++ and Python
- Write a first function named `wins_rock_scissors_paper`. Description: this function passes two strings. Each of the two strings are going to be one of 3 values: rock, paper, scissors.
-  Write a second function named `factorial`. Description: this function is passed a non-negative integer, that we will call n in this description. Function returns n! (pronounced n fatorial). n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2)... * 1 Thus, 3! = 3 * 2 * 1. Note that 0! is 1 by definition.
- Write a third function named `fibonacci`. Description: this function is passed a non-negative integer, that we will call n in this description. function returns the nth fibonacci number in the fibonacci sequence.
- Write a fourth function named `sum_to_goal`. Description: This function finds the two numbers in the list that sum up to the goal value. Function returns the product of the two numbers(the product is the result of multiplying the two numbers together). If there are no two numbers that when summed results in the goal state, function returns 0
- In Lab1.py write a `UpCounter` keeps track of a number. The number can be increased by a fixed step size.
- A  `DownCounter` is initialized with same arguments as an `UpCounter`. The only difference is that when the update() function is called, the counter decrements the counter value by stepsize
