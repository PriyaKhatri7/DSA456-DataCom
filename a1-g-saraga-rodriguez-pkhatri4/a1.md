### Analysis of insert()

Analyze your insert() function with respect to the number of nodes in the list

```python
	def insert(self,data):
		if (self.front.next == self.back):
			ref = self.front
		else:
			curr = self.front.next
			while (curr != self.back and data > curr.data):
				curr=curr.next
			ref= curr.prev
		nn = SortedList.Node(data, ref.next, ref)
		ref.next.prev = nn
		ref.next = nn
```

**Analysis**

In the worst case, to keep the list sorted the data to be inserted must be located at the end, so the whole list is traversed.

```python
def insert(self,data):
	if (self.front.next == self.back):			# 1 . 1 Operator ==
		ref = self.front				# 0
    	else:       
		curr = self.front.next				# 1 . 1 Operator =
		while (curr != self.back and data > curr.data):	# 3*(n+1) . 3 Operators (>, and, !=) repeated n+1 times, till reach the sentinel node
			curr=curr.next                          # 1*n . 1 Operator = repeated n times
		ref= curr.prev                                  # 1
	####################################			Complexity of insert a node in a link List Should be Constant O(1)
	nn = SortedList.Node(data, ref.next, ref)               # 1 + T(n) for init the Sorted List Node, that should be O(1), cause it is only assigning values. 
	ref.next.prev = nn                                      # 1 . 1 Operator                                 
	ref.next = nn                                           # 1 . 1 Operator
	####################################			T(n) = 3 + O(1). -> O(1). Complexity of insert a node in a link List Should be Constant O(1)
```

$$ T(n) = 1 + 1 + 3*(n+1) + n + 1 + O(1) $$

$$ T(n) = 4n + 6 + O(1) $$

Since $O(1)$ is constant, the dominant term is 4n,

Therefore, $T(n)$ is $O(n)$


### Analysis of remove()

Analyze your remove() function with respect to the number of nodes in the list

```python
	def remove(self,data):
		if (self.front.next == self.back):
			return False
		else:
			curr = self.front.next
			while (curr != self.back and data >= curr.data):
				if curr.data == data:
					curr.next.prev = curr.prev
					curr.prev.next = curr.next
					curr = None
					return True
				curr = curr.next
			return False
```

**Analysis**

The worst case is data is greater than all the data in list and it is found in the last position and deleted. But is the same complexity that when data is greater than all the data in list and it is not found to delete it, just a few more operations in the first case.

```python
	def remove(self,data):			
		if (self.front.next == self.back):				# 1 . 1 Operator ==
			return False						# 0 
		else:
			curr = self.front.next					# 1 . 1 Operator =
			while (curr != self.back and data >= curr.data):	# 3*(n + 1) . 3 Operators, !=, and >= repeated n+1 times, till reach the sentinel node
				if curr.data == data:				# 1*(n + 1) . 1 Operator =, repeated (n-1) times
				####################################		Complexity of delete a node in a link List Should be Constant O(1)
					curr.next.prev = curr.prev		# 1 . 1 Operator =
					curr.prev.next = curr.next		# 1 . 1 Operator =
					curr = None				# 1 . 1 Operator =
					return True				# 1 . 1 Operator Return
				####################################		4 Operators. T(n) of delete a node => O(1)
				curr = curr.next				# 1*(n + 1) . 1 Operator =, repeated (n-1) times
			return False						# 0 
```

$$ T(n) = 1 + 1 + 3(n+1) + (n+1) + (n+1) + O(1) $$

$$ T(n) = 5n + 7 + O(1) $$

Since $O(1)$ is constant, the dominant term is 5n,

Therefore, $T(n)$ is $O(n)$

### Analysis of is_present()

Analyze your is_present() function with respect to the number of nodes in the list

```python
    def is_present(self, data):
        if (self.front.next == self.back):
            return False
        else:
            curr = self.front.next
            while (curr != self.back and data >= curr.data):
                if curr.data == data:
                    return True
                curr = curr.next
            return False
```

**Analysis**

In the worst case, data is greater than al the data in list, and it is not found, the whole list is traversed.

```python
    def is_present(self, data):
        if (self.front.next == self.back):                    # 1 . 1 Operator ==
            return False                                      # 0
        else:   
            curr = self.front.next                            # 1 . 1 Operator =
            while (curr != self.back and data >= curr.data):  # 3*(n + 1) . 3 Operators, !=, and >= repeated n+1 times, till reach the sentinel node
                if curr.data == data:                         # 1*n . (1 Operator == repeated n times)
                    return True                               # 0
                curr = curr.next                              # 1*n . (1 Operator = repeated n times)
            return False                                      # 1 . 1 Return
```

$$ T(n) = 1 + 1 + 3(n+1) + n + n +1 $$

$$ T(n) = 5n + 6 $$

The dominant term is 5n,

Therefore, $T(n)$ is $O(n)$


### Analysis of \_\_len\_\_()

Analyze your ```__len()__``` function with respect to the number of nodes in the list

```python
    def __len__(self):
        count = 0
        if (self.front.next == self.back):
            return count
        else:
            curr = self.front.next
            while (curr != self.back):
                count+=1
                curr = curr.next
            return count
```

**Analysis**

This function has only two options, either SortedList is empty and returns 0, or it goes through the entire list counting and returns the result. For this reason, the worst case scenario is that the SortedList is not empty.

```python
    def __len__(self):
        count = 0                                   # 1 . 1 Operator =
        if (self.front.next == self.back):          # 1 . 1 Operator ==
            return count
        else:
            curr = self.front.next                  # 1 . 1 Operator =
            while (curr != self.back):              # 1*(n+1) . 1 Operator != repeated n+1 times, till reach the sentinel node
                count+=1                            # 1*n . 1 Operator += repeated n times
                curr = curr.next                    # 1*n . 1 Operator =
            return count                            # 1 . 1 Return
```

$$ T(n) = 1 + 1 + 1 + (n+1) + n + n +1 $$

$$ T(n) = 3n + 5 $$

The dominant term is 3n,

Therefore, $T(n)$ is $O(n)$

## Reflection


### Tell us what you found most challenging when implementing your assignment. What helped you overcome your challenges, what was most useful?

Some difficulties faces while doing this assignment was to first fully understand sentinel nodes and non-sentinel nodes. We decided to go with sentinal for this assignment and while working on the drawings, we noticed how important is it to go through the steps in getting the final results for insert and remove, however once doing one or two of them, they were much simpler to understand the pattern and go through the rest of them. 

Additionally, we had great difficulties using python to make the code. At first we didn't know if we should use the iterators internally, then we had to carry out many tests to know how far we should iterate without missing a case or getting an error. Finally, what helped us was to start with one of the functions, and trying to do the code first and then the drawing. Because every time we drew a new case, we could identify if there was missing code to cover. After doing this to understand the logic it was much simplier to figure out the remaining ones.

Undoubtedly, what was most helpful was the exercise on linked list to prepare for the test done in the last class, since it allowed us to take the idea of the reference node. The operations in general always have the same steps, but since we had only seen them in the front node, we did not know at the beginning of identifying the node if we should reach it using for example front.next.next.next location, since this need to be general for all cases. But having this exercise in mind, it was easy to identify that we should declare a reference that will point to the node we needed, and then do all the insert work. For remove, is_present and len it was not necessary, because when traversing the list we could use the current node.

Also a challenge that was faced during the analysis was to identify how to take the creation of the node during the insert, but then we remember that the advantage of the linked list is that these operations have a constant order, so we take this part as if it were a small function that was executed inside the other, we are not sure if it is correct or not. We apply this same concept to remove.

However this assignment was very helpful in building off an understanding from the class lab in working with sorts, how sorts work and to use them in sentinal and non-sentinal nodes, and understand in a practical way how a linked list works, in this case a sorted linked list. In completing in this assignment and understanding how to analyze the functions given, we feel that we are hopfully better prepared for the midterm.
