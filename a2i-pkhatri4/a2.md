#Part A: Analysis:

Given the SortedTable class:
```python

	# packaging the key-value pair into one object

Analyze the functions in the above code that is listed below with respect to the number of records in the table.  Provide the final answer (in big-O notation) into the table.  Show your rough work by doing a proper analysis below the summary table of the functions

## Summary table

| Function | run time with respect to number of records in table | 
|---|---|
|def insert(self, key, value):| O(n^2)|
|def modify(self, key, value):| O(log n) |
|def remove(self, key):| O(log n) |
|def search(self, key):| O(n) |
|def capacity(self):| O(1) |
|def __len__(self):| O(n) |

## Analysis of 	def insert(self, key, value):

```python
def insert(self, key, value):
		if (self.search(key)!=None):		# O(1) 1 operator !=
			return False			# O(1) - 0 

		if(len(self) == self.cap):			# O(1) 1 operator ==
			# increase the capacity if list is full
			new_table = [None for i in range(self.cap*2)]	# O(1) 2 operators =, * 
			for i in range(self.cap):						# O(log n) 0. 
				new_table[i]=self.the_table[i]				# O(1) 0. new_table grows because *2 1 operator = 
			self.the_table = new_table						# O(1) 1 operator =
			self.cap *= 2									# O(log n) 2 operators *, =. multiplying by 2. a constant

		self.the_table[len(self)]=self.Record(key,value)	# 1 - O(1) 
		size = len(self)									# 1 - O(1) 1 operator =
		for i in range (0,size-1):							# O(n^2) 1 operator -
			for j in range(0,size-1-i):						# 2 operator -, -. This would be considered a constant
				if(self.the_table[j].key>self.the_table[j+1].key): #O(1) 2 operators >, +
					tmp=self.the_table[j] 				# O(1) 1 operator =
					self.the_table[j]=self.the_table[j+1] # 2 operator =, +
					self.the_table[j+1]=tmp				# 2 operator +, =
		return True						# O(1) - 0
```
$$ T(n) = O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + o(1) + O(log n) + O(1) + O(1) + O(n^2) + O(n^2) + O(1) $$

$$ T(n) = O(1) + O(n^2) $$

If the key isn't found in the list, the function would have to search through the entire list. This would take O(n) time.

If the key isn't found, the function also has to insert the key into the list and loop through the entire list again to find where to insert the new key. This would take another O(n) time for a total of O(n^2) time.

Therefore, this function has an O(n^2) time complexity. 

## Analysis of def modify(self, key, value):

```python
def modify(self, key, value):
		i = 0 # O(1) - 1 operation
		while (i < len(self) and self.the_table[i].key != key): # O(log n) - 3*(n + 1) - 2 operators <, and != repeated n + 1 times
			i+=1 # 1 operator +=
		if(i==len(self)): # O(1) - 1 operator ==
			return False # O(1)
		else:
			self.the_table[i].value = value #O(1)
			return True # O(1)
```

$$ T(n) = O(1) + O(log n) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) $$

$$ T(n) = O(1) + O(log n) $$

Since the while loop operation is performed multiple times, it is performed logarithmically with respect to the size of the input.

Therefore, this function has a time complexity of O(log n).

## Analysis of def remove(self, key):

```python
def remove(self, key):
		i = 0 # O(1) - 1 operator =
		size = len(self) # O(1) - 1 operator =
		while (i < size and self.the_table[i].key != key): # O(log n) - 3*(n+1) - 2 operators <, and !=
			i+=1 # O(1) - 1 operator +=
		if(i==size): # O(1) - 1 operator ==
			return False # O(1)
		while(i+1 < size): # O(log n) - 2 operators +, and <
			self.the_table[i]=self.the_table[i+1] # 2 operators =, and +
			i+=1 # O(1) - 1 operator +=
		self.the_table[i] = None # O(1) - 1 operator =
		return True # O(1)
```

$$ T(n) = O(1) + O(1) + O(log n) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(log n) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) $$

$$ T(n) = O(1) + O(log n) $$

Since this function also has the while loop performing multiple times, and performed logarithmically with respect to the size of the input.

Therefore, this function has a time complexity of O(log n).

## Analysis of def search(self, key):

```python
def search(self, key):
		i = 0 # O(1) - 1 operator =
		size = len(self) # O(1) - 1 operator =
		while  i < size and self.the_table[i].key != key : # O(n) - 3*(n+1) - 2 operators <, and !=
			i+=1 # O(1) - 1 operator +=
		if i==size: # O(1) - 1 operator ==
			return None # O(1)
		else:
			return self.the_table[i].value # O(1)
```
$$ T(n) = O(1) + O(1) + O(n) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) $$

$$ T(n) = O(n) $$

Since this is a constant operation it will take constant time. However the while loop is taking time dependent on the time comparison operation is done. It in turn is dependent on the "size" and whether the key in table matches with given key or not. 

In worst case, the keys would never match and so all the "size" entries would be checked. Also the iteration is increased by "1" each time so the number of times the while loop would execute is directly proportional to the "size", and if we consider "size" as our "n", we can say that the time would be order of (n).

Therefore, the time complexity of this function is O(n).


## Analysis of def capacity(self):

```python
def capacity(self):
		return self.cap #O(1)
```
$$ T(n) = O(1) $$

Since this is just a return statement, it would be an O(1) time complexity.

## Analysis of def __len__(self):

```python
def __len__(self):
		i = 0 # O(1) - 1 operator =
		count = 0 # O(1) - 1 operator =
		while(i < len(self.the_table)): # O(n) - 1 operator <
			if(self.the_table[i]!=None): # O(1) - 1 operator !=
				count+=1 # O(1) - 1 operator +=
			i+=1 # O(1) - 1 operator +=
		return count # O(1)
```

$$ T(n) = O(1) + O(1) + O(n) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) $$

$$ T(n) = O(n) $$

Since the while loop iterates through the entire table, the time complexity would be O(n).

# Part B: Improvements

* Suggestion 2:

## Reflection
Some difficulties that i've faced in a2.py was learning the idea of chaining hash and from my understand the idea behind a chaining has table is to store records in a list at eash index of the has table. This allows for constant time insertion and loopup, as long as the lists aren't too long. However, if the lsits do get too long, then the forformance of the has table will degrade. One thing that i learned how to prevent this is to resize the hash table when the load factor (the ratio of the number of records to the size of the has table) exceeds a certain threshold. In this case, i found that i can double the size of the hash table, and re-hash all of the keys. This will likley result in shorter lists, and thus better performance.

Another issue that can arise with chaning has tables is that of collisions. If two keys hash to the same index, then they will be stores in the same lists. This can cause performance issues if the lists get too long. One way to avoid this is to use a good hash function that minimizes collisions. Another way to deal with collisions is to use a different collision resolution strategy, such as linear probing.

The code in a2.py first implements a hash table using chaining which uses a list of Records as it's underlying data structure. Each record object stores a key-value pair. When an insert, remove, modify or search operation is performed, the key is used to find the corresponding record in the list. 
 - The __init__ function is used to initialize the list of Records. It takes a capacity argument, which is the maximum number of Records that can be stored in the table.
 - The insert function takes two arguments: a key and a value. It calculates the index of the Record using the key and the length of the table. If the index is empty, it creates a new Record with the given key and value and inserts it in the list. If the index is not empty, it checks if the Record with the given key already exists in the list. If it does, the insert operation is aborted and False is returned. If it does not, the new Record is added to the list and True is returned.
 - The modify function is similar to the insert function. It takes two arguments: a key and a value. It calculates the index of the Record using the key and the length of the table. If the index is empty, it aborts the operation and returns False. If it is not empty, it checks if the Record with the given key already exists in the list. If it does, the value of the Record is updated to the given value and True is returned. If it does not, the operation is aborted and False is returned.
 - The remove function takes a key as an argument. It calculates the index of the Record using the key and the length of the table. If the index is empty, it aborts the operation and returns False. If the index is not empty, it checks if the Record with the given key exists in the list. If it does, the Record is removed from the list and True is returned. If it does not, the operation is aborted and False is returned.
 - The search function takes a key as an argument. It calculates the index of the Record using the key and the length of the table. If the index is empty, it returns None. If the index is not empty, it checks if the Record with the given key exists in the list. If it does, the value of the Record is returned. If it does not, None is returned.
 - The capacity function returns the number of spots in the table. This consists of spots available in the table.
 - The __len__ function returns the number of records in the table.
