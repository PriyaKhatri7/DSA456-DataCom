# Lab 0
What aspect of the lab did you find to be the hardest? I think the hardest part of this lab trying to learn how the LaTex section is supposed to be done until I read it again later and then understood that it was much simplier than I understood it to be as well as trying to see the preview of the code and learning the syntax of it.

What do you think about CodeSpaces? What did you like/not like about Codespaces? I like Codespaces, it allows me to practise my github basic commands. This is something I use a bit at work as well through git extensions and visual studios but I think github and Codespaces is a great tool to learn and get used to.

## LaTex Formulas
Here is a sentence with the  quadratic formula $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$ embbed inline.

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

Hypotenus of a right angle triangle: $c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)$

Geometric series: sum from $i=0 to n (ar^i)$

Arithmetic series closed form: sum from $i = 1 to n (i) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4...n=(n)(n+1)/2$
