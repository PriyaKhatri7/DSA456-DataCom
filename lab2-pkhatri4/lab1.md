# Reflection for Lab 1

I liked learning the basic syntax about python and also using recursion in a different way, it was fun to explore. It was a bit difficult to clear the errors I was getting as i don't feel it was an easy fix.

In the class Upcounter i had to research a bit on that because i wasn't exactly sure what it was supposed to do at first but the more i worked on it, I eventually got to figuring out how it's supposed to work

The logic between Python and C/C++ is pretty similar like using for loops and if else statements, the major difference is the syntax and implementations. As well as using it through github.
