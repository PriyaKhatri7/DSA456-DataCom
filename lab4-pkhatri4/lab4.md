## Simple sorts

	* which algorithm did you find easiest to understand?
		Compared to other sorts, the flow of the bubble sort was much simplier to understand. The bubble sort 
		took the longest time and it was tetius, however it was much more linear and accessible for beginners. 
		Bubble sort is to compare the first 2 numbers and move it backwards to keep it in order and repeat 
		until it is all in ascending order. It seemed closer to the way I would attempt to solve a problem 
		like this in my early years of programming.

	* which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort?
		The insertion sort was the fastest because it didn't have to go through as many steps since you move it 
		down compared to the other sorts that had more process to it. This is also a more efficent way when running 
		code to get the better possible answer, especially for dealing with larger data files or future labs. 
		Since there are mostly likley a high number of swaps, it's expected to generate twice as many write operations 
		with bubble sort compared to insertion sorts. Therefore, we may prefer an insertion sort for an algorithm with 
		an ordinary sorting job along with efficiency for cost operations.


## Merging Unsorted lists

	* how long did this take
	2:39:83
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
		* How many times? 
		There was aproximately 6 mistakes made going through the numbers and the order since the person was trying to 
		work quicker in sorting through a bigger unsorted pile. After doing the merging sorted list exercise it is a 
		very clear reason as to why this takes longer and not as efficient as other methods can be. For this reason 
		it can take longer for the program to get the correct numbers compared to a different method.


## Merging Sorted lists

	* how long did this take
		00:58:08
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
		* How many times?
		There were no mistakes. It seemed more helpful in not making mistakes because they were already sorted so the 
		numbers were easier to work through. Looking at the time it took to sort through the merging sorted and merging 
		unsorted, there is a very clear distinct time difference between the two, however an interesting exercise to 
		experience at first hand.

## Sorting larger data sets

|Team member | Sorting time|
|---|---|
| Priya Khatri | 2:31:57 |
| Anusmita Chanda | 2:47:99 |
| Sthefany Raga | 01:56:31 |

What was fastest time?
Sthefany was the fastest time with 1:56

Describe the algorithm produced by the team member with fastest time.
Sthefany used the method of sorting them by 10s and then arranging them after which seems like it reduces the time to move them 
to make space for the new numbers. This seemed like the faster method because it is similar to the merging sorted method oh somewhat 
sorted and making the full list of numbers compared to an entire unsorted pile which will take longer to sort through

## Partitioning

* how long did it take to partition the data set?
01:12

## Sorting the small piles

* how long did it take for you to sort all of the little piles? 
01:08:85

## Putting it together

* As a team discuss things that helped sort the papers... what was useful? what was fast to do?  What was slow? 
	Partitioning sort was faster because it was easier to work with in already being sorted into subpiles, therefore sorting it 
	after that was quicker compared to bubble sort from the begining or an unsorted list. Compared to a bubble sort which can be 
	titius, it was helpful that there were smaller piles aka a 3rd of the pile to already pre-do half the work before sorting. 
	However if we are looking at all method, it was easier to use the insertion or selection method while partioning which gave 
	us faster results and essentially was the method that was most similar while partitioning.

* As a team come up with a description of how best to sort a set of numbers on paper.
	It seemed the fastest to sort when dividing them up into smaller numbers similar to the method that sthefany used where she 
	divided them into subcategories by 10s (20s on one side and 60s on another) which gave us faster results and was a similar 
	way with the partitioning method that we did near the end.

* Mix up all your numbers and have each member of the team perform the sort you did.  How long did it take?
